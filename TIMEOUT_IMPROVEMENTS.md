# Timeout & Progress Monitoring Improvements

## Problem
Complex LLM requests (story generation, etc.) were timing out after 30-60 seconds, but can take up to 15+ minutes to complete.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Increased Timeouts
- **OpenWebUI HTTP Client**: 60s → 1200s (20 minutes)
- **OllamaClient Chat Completions**: 30s → 1200s (20 minutes) 
- **OllamaClient Ollama Fallback**: 30s → 1200s (20 minutes)
- **ToolServer OpenWebUI Requests**: 60s → 1200s (20 minutes)
- **ToolServer Embeddings**: 30s → 300s (5 minutes)
- **ToolServer RAG Generation**: 30s → 300s (5 minutes)

### 2. Progress Monitoring System
Added intelligent progress monitoring that:
- **Starts automatically** when long-running requests begin
- **Outputs info messages every 30 seconds** to show request is still active
- **Shows elapsed time** (e.g., "5m 30s")
- **Displays check count** for monitoring frequency
- **Stops automatically** when request completes (success or failure)

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Progress Monitor Functions
```javascript
_startProgressMonitor(requestType, model)    // Returns interval ID
_stopProgressMonitor(intervalId, type, model, success)  // Cleanup
```

#### Progress Messages Example
```
[INFO] [OpenWebUI Chat] Started request with model "llama3.2:latest"
[INFO] [OpenWebUI Chat] Request with model "llama3.2:latest" is still running (1m 30s, check #3)
[INFO] [OpenWebUI Chat] Request with model "llama3.2:latest" is still running (3m 0s, check #6)
[INFO] [OpenWebUI Chat] Request with model "llama3.2:latest" completed successfully
```

### 4. Components Updated

#### OllamaClient
- `_processChatViaOpenWebUI()` - Progress monitoring for primary OpenWebUI requests
- `_processChatViaOllama()` - Progress monitoring for Ollama fallback requests

#### ToolServer  
- `_callOpenWebUI()` - Progress monitoring for ToolServer chat completions
- RAG and embedding requests with extended timeouts

#### HttpClient
- OpenWebUI instance timeout increased to 20 minutes
- Ollama instance timeout increased to 20 minutes

### 5. Benefits
- **No more premature timeouts** for complex story generation (15+ minutes)
- **Real-time feedback** showing requests are still active
- **Automatic cleanup** of monitoring intervals
- **Better user experience** with progress information
- **Debugging support** with elapsed time tracking

### 6. Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Progress monitoring is automatic and non-intrusive
- Fallback mechanisms still work with extended timeouts

### 7. Testing
System tested with:
- Progress monitor start/stop functionality
- Interval cleanup verification
- Multiple request types
- Error handling scenarios

## Result
Users can now:
- Submit complex prompts that take 15+ minutes to complete
- See progress updates every 30 seconds
- Know their request hasn't "hung" or failed
- Get better feedback on long-running operations
